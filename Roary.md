# Roary

- From a metal smithing family
- Mom was the craftsman, dad would gather materials from caves
- Dad disappeared, after much convincing, Mom let me take up Dad's work
- Now I've disappeared :(
- From the outskirts of the city of Silvery Moon
  - Ruled by a powerful wizard, Lustriel Silverhand a.k.a. "The Lady", a Chosen of Mystra, the Goddess of Magic
- Most of what I know about the underdark comes from my dad's tall-tales of the time he went there

Custom skill: Lore (Underdark) – INT
